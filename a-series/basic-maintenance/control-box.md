The A133, a vehicle renowned for its reliability and performance, has a control box that the user rarely needs to access, but when they do, it might seem tricky at first glance. However, with the right set of instructions, “popping the hood” on the A133 can be a straightforward process. Follow these step-by-step instructions to successfully access the engine compartment for maintenance or inspection.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and materials ready:

* 17mm ratchet wrench
* Short Phillips head screwdriver
* 7/16 wrench or socket
* Assistant or a clamp (optional but helpful)
* Safety goggles and gloves (for added protection)

## Steps to Pop the Hood

### Step 1: Locate and Remove the Front Body Bolts

1. Start by identifying the six bolts that connect the front body to the rear body. These bolts are typically located around the perimeter of the front body.
1. Using the appropriate tool, carefully remove all six bolts. It's crucial to keep track of these bolts as they will be needed for reattachment.

## Reattachment Tips
When reattaching the front and rear body or performing maintenance tasks, consider the following helpful tips:

* If the front bolt for attaching the rear body doesn't line up during reattachment, try loosening the two rear bolts slightly. Be cautious during this step, as it can be easy to pinch your fingers.

* When removing the top two bolts that connect the front and rear body, a short Phillips head screwdriver may be helpful due to limited space.
