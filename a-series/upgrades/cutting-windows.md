### in the A133 Cargo Bike (with Box Back)

## Introduction

If you're looking to add some windows to your A133 Cargo Bike's box back, you're in the right place. Adding windows can not only improve the aesthetics of your cargo bike but also provide better visibility. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to cut windows into the A133 Cargo Bike's box back. You won't need any special parts, just a few tools and some patience.

### Tools Required:

- 3‚Äù carbide hole saw
- Metal shears
- Cardboard template
- Straight edge
- Marking tool (e.g., a Sharpie)

## Steps:

### Step 1: Create a Cardboard Template

A small piece of cardboard can be an invaluable tool when adding windows to your cargo bike's box back. Start by creating a cardboard template that indicates the center of each window hole. It's crucial to leave some room for trim to grab onto the edge of the hole, so the edge of the hole should not be flush with the support bar.

### Step 2: Drill Corner Holes

Using the cardboard template you created in Step 1, position it on the box back and drill holes at the corners of each proposed window. At this point, your box will resemble a piece of Swiss cheese with holes all over it.

### Step 3: Mark Cutting Lines

Now, grab a straight edge and your marking tool (Sharpie or similar). Mark lines from the edge of each hole to the next hole in the series. These lines will serve as your cutting guides in the next step. Be precise and ensure that the lines are straight and evenly spaced.

### Step 4: Cut Along the Lines

Using your metal shears, carefully cut along the lines you marked in the previous step. Take your time and make steady, controlled cuts. The metal shears should make relatively quick work of cutting through the box's material. Be cautious not to apply excessive force, as this can result in jagged edges.

Once you've completed this step, you should have cleanly cut windows in your A133 Cargo Bike's box back, allowing you to enjoy improved visibility and a more personalized look for your cargo bike.

Remember, safety first! Always wear appropriate safety gear when working with tools, and take your time to ensure accurate and clean cuts. With a bit of patience and the right tools, you'll have stylish and functional windows added to your cargo bike's box back in no time.

Happy biking!
